# Image Based Physarum Simulation

## Build Instructions

Note: The build process should work on all platforms, but it has only been tested on Linux.

```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The program expects to find the asset folder in the directory it is run from. The folder is automatically copied to the cmake build directory.
